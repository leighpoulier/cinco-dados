# Cinco Dados

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

"Cinco Dados" is Espa√±ol for "Five Dice".  Five Dice is a dice game played with ... you guessed it ... five dice.  You probably know it by another name, which is a trademark, so I won't be using that name!

Cinco Dados is my take on this game and is dedicated to my partner Luis, who is Mexican, with whom i play it often.  It can be played solo or with friends. The game involves rolling five dice to achieve certain combinations of matching or sequentially numbered dice, and strategically inserting those rolls into the available slots on the score card, to maximise your score. 

The application is intended to be used as entertainment, by anyone who enjoys casual games. Each game takes around 10-15 minutes to complete, per player.

The game will contain a visual representation of the dice, built from ASCII characters that can be displayed in a terminal. It is intended that navigation and command selection within the game screen will be via the arrow keys and the space/enter key, to control the movement and activation of a cursor.

The application will commence with a menu, where the number of players is established, and each player can enter their name.  Once this information is entered, the application will change to the main game screen.

On the main game screen is the score card table, showing the progress of each player and their scores for each of the dice combinations.
